            <h1>Trogloxenes</h1>
            <p>Trogloxenes or subtroglophiles,
                also called cave guests, are animal species which
                periodically live in underground habitats such as caves
                or at the very entrance, but cannot live exclusively in
                such habitats. Among many scientists, trogloxenes and
                subtroglophile have slightly different
                but closely related meanings, with the former
                covering species that are occasional visitors to
                underground habitat and the latter species that live
                more permanently there, but have to go outside
                (for example, to find food). Both these are in contrast
                to troglobites, which strictly live in underground habitats.

            <p>The term troglophile refers to organisms that are able to live
                their entire life in a cave. This includes various cave-dwelling
                animals, such as certain insects and small mammals, which have adapted
                to life in dark, isolated environments. Troglophiles can either live
                entirely inside the cave or preferentially spend time there, making them distinct
                from other cave-dwelling species that may leave the cave occasionally for food or other reasons.

            <p>A troglobite (or, formally, troglobiont) is an animal species,
                or population of a species, strictly bound to underground habitats,
                such as caves. These are separate from species that mainly live in above-ground
                habitats but are also able to live underground (eutroglophiles), and species
                that are only cave visitors (subtroglophiles and trogloxenes). Land-dwelling
                troglobites may be referred to as troglofauna, while aquatic species may be called
                stygofauna, although for these animals the term stygobite is preferable.
